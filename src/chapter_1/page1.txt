hello Ekaterina,

You are doing great! You are soft gentle and beautiful. I love you.

Soon you will be able to write in java and you will get a 100K job in September or October. You got this! I believe in you.

Right now you may feel like you can't accomplish anything in java especially. And your personal life is a bit wack, everything will get better. You will get what you want!

This is a letter to the future from the past :)
